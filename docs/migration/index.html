            <h1>Migrating to v5</h1>

<p> <div class="p-5 bg-gray-200 border-l-4 border-blue-500">
    <span>If you are a Hosted Invoice Ninja you can skip all of these steps. Just log into your account, click on the Start Migration button in Settings > Account Management and we will take care of the rest. Once you are happy your data is across you can follow the steps in our <a href="https://invoiceninja.github.io/docs/hosted-activate/">Activation</a> guide</span>
</div> </p>

<p> <div class="p-5 bg-gray-200 border-l-4 border-red-500">
    <span>You need to setup this version (v5) completely from scratch. Do not attempt to overwrite your old version of Invoice Ninja (4.x.x) with this version as the two codebases are completely different.</span>
</div> </p>

<h2>Preparing v4.</h2>

<p>The first step needed to prepare to migrate your data across to your new v5 installation is to update your v4 installation to the <a href="https://download.invoiceninja.com">latest version</a> available. This is a critical step and you will see problems migrating your data if you do not update to the latest v4.</p>

<h2>Installing v5.</h2>

<p>Installing v5 is covered in detail <a href="/docs/self-host-installation">here</a> with resources to cover your needs for Docker / Shared Hosting or Ubuntu/Centos installations.</p>

<p>An important detail with your v5 installation is that your initial user login is identical to your v4 installation.</p>

<p>The migration relies heavily on the Laravel queue system, so you will need to ensure that you have configured the cron scheduler which boots the laravel queue for you. If you do not configure the cron scheduler, the migration will not work and you will end up with a blank company with no content.</p>

<p> <div class="p-5 bg-gray-200 border-l-4 border-red-500">
    <span>Please note v5.3.0 now requires PHP 7.4. For some environments you may need to consider using a platform which enables you to use multiple version of PHP. Most reputable web hosts offer cPanel with MultiPHP switcher</span>
</div> </p>

<h2>Starting the migration</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/images/migration/migration_step_1.png" alt="alt text" title="Start migration" /></p>

<p>Navigate to Settings > Account Management and scroll down until you see the Start Migration button.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/migration/migration_step_2.png" alt="alt text" title="Select self hosted" /></p>

<p>After clicking <code>Start migration</code>, you'll get another screen, simply select the self-host radio button and continue.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/migration/migration_step_3.png" alt="alt text" title="Enter URL" /></p>

<p>The next screen asks for the full qualified domain name of your v5 installation, enter this including the http:// or https:// in your URL, ie</p>

<p><code>http:://ninja.test</code></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/migration/migration_step_4.png" alt="alt text" title="Authenticate" /></p>

<p>The next screen requires you to enter your login credentials, remembering that these should be identical between your v4 and v5 installation. You'll also notice an additional field <code>API_SECRET</code> this can be ignore if you do not have a value set for this in your <code>.env</code> file.</p>

<p>If you experience an error at this point, most likely either your credentials are wrong, or the URL you have entered is not correct.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/migration/migration_step_5.png" alt="alt text" title="Select company" /></p>

<p>If you successfully authenticate you'll see the next screen which allows you to select the companies you wish to migrate.</p>

<p>Important points at this stage:</p>

<ul>
<li>Force migration will overwrite an existing company that has already been migrated to v5, this is destructive and cannot be undone.
<br><strong>NOTE:</strong> If the 1st Migration fails and only part of the data got transferred, PURGE and DELETE the Data/Company and retry the process with "Force migration" checked.</li>
<li>Just selecting the checkbox next to the company name will attempt a migration if the company has never been migrated to the v5 installation. This is a non-destructive migration. ie. it will not overwrite a matching company.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/migration/migration_step_6.png" alt="alt text" title="Migration started" /></p>

<h2>v5 Migration Process</h2>

<p>With a little luck, you should have already received an email notification advising the migration has completed!</p>

<p>There are a couple of things you will want to check to ensure the data has come across correctly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure your company logo has migrated (Settings > Company Details > Logo)</li>
<li>Ensure the migrated data passes our data quality check by running</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-php">php artisan ninja:check-data
</code></pre>

<p>A series of checks are run and if you see 0 issues, that means your data has come across correctly.</p>

<ul>
<li>You'll also want to inspect the logs located in :</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-bash">storage/logs/laravel.log
</code></pre>

<p>Inside here you will see output such as this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">[2021-01-30 10:46:04] development.INFO: Importing account

</code></pre>

<p>This example output would indicate that each entity was successfully brought across, if a problem is detected early the migration will fail early and return an error. A Laravel error will also be thrown indicating the exact issue.</p>

<h2>Forwarding users from v4 to v5</h2>

<p>When you have completed the migration and are happy with the configuration of your v4 installation, it is time to forward your users with existing v4 invitations to your v5 installation.</p>

<p>In v4 navigate to Settings > Account Management - Forward customers to v5.</p>

<p>Enter in the URL for your v5 installation and click save. When your users use existing v4 links, they will be transparently forwarded to your v5 installation.</p>

<p>For hosted users, you can discover your full URL by navigating in v5 to Settings > Client Portal. The Subdomain field will be whatever the subdomain value is with invoicing.co on the end. ie.</p>

<p> <div class="p-5 bg-gray-200 border-l-4 border-red-500">
    <span>Note! Once you have enabled forwarding. Your v4 account will become disabled. This means that your recurring invoices and reminders / auto billing will no longer be performed from this installation at all.</span>
</div> </p>

<p>https://subdomain.invoicing.co</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>If you are experiencing issues with the migration not running as expected please run through the following checklist:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure directories are read/writable by the webuser (ie www-data)</li>
<li>Ensure the cron scheduler is running (and working) - You can verify it is working by inspecting the <code>jobs</code> table in the database, it should be empty</li>
<li>Inspect the log file /storage/logs/laravel.log for further information.</li>
<li>If you are still experiencing issues, turn on advanced logging by adding the following variable to your .env file. EXPANDED_LOGGING=true then optimize with php artisan optimize . Then attempt the migration again and afterwards inspect the log file in storage/logs/invoiceninja.log</li>
<li>If using <code>https://</code> ensure you are using a signed SSL certificate, you may get authentication errors if you attempt to use a self signed certificate. Free ssl's are available from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">lets encrypt</a></li>
<li>Still having troubles? search the <a href="https://forum.invoiceninja.com">forum</a> or come and chat with us on <a href="https://invoiceninja.slack.com">slack</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Migration Failed notifications</h2>

<p>The app will do its best to report back a human readable error if the migration fails for some reason.</p>

<p>Some known issues when migrating to our hosted platform include:</p>

<pre><code>"This user is unable to be attached to this company. Perhaps they have already registered a user on another account?"
</code></pre>

<p>If you see this error it indicates that one of your users has already registered their own account on the hosted platform. We do not support cross account users for security purposes. You'll need to change the user's email address in your v4 installation to a different email address for the migration to succeed.</p>

<h2>Cross account migration</h2>

<p>Migration from version 4 to version 5 is only allowed between accounts with the same e-mail address. This is requirement,
and before starting the migration, make sure you are using the same e-mail address on both version 4 and version 5 for the user.</p>
